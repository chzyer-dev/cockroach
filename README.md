## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It **scales** horizontally; **survives** disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports **strongly-consistent** ACID transactions; and provides a familiar **SQL** API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

For more details, see our [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html), [documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs), and [design overview](#overview).

## Status

CockroachDB is currently in beta. See our
[Roadmap](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/2132) and
[Issues](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues) for a list of features planned or in development.

## Quickstart 

1.  [Install Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/install-cockroachdb.html).

2.  [Start a local cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/start-a-local-cluster.html) with three nodes listening on different ports:

    ```shell
    $ ./cockroach start --insecure &
    $ ./cockroach start --insecure --store=cockroach-data2 --port=26258 --http-port=8081 --join=localhost:26257 &
    $ ./cockroach start --insecure --store=cockroach-data3 --port=26259 --http-port=8082 --join=localhost:26257 &
    ```

3.  [Start the built-in SQL client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) as an interactive shell:

    ```shell
    $ ./cockroach sql --insecure
    # Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
    # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
    # To exit: CTRL + D.
    ```

4. Run some [CockroachDB SQL statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

    ```shell
    root@:26257> CREATE DATABASE bank;
    CREATE DATABASE

    root@:26257> SET DATABASE = bank;
    SET

    root@:26257> CREATE TABLE accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);
    CREATE TABLE

    root@26257> INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (1234, DECIMAL '10000.50');
    INSERT 1

    root@26257> SELECT * FROM accounts;
    +------+----------+
    |  id  | balance  |
    +------+----------+
    | 1234 | 10000.50 |
    +------+----------+
    ```

4. Checkout the admin UI by pointing your browser to `http://<localhost>:8080`.

5. CockroachDB makes it easy to [secure a cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/secure-a-cluster.html).

## Client Drivers

CockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so you can use any available PostgreSQL client drivers to connect from various languages. For recommended drivers that we've tested, see [Install Client Drivers](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/install-client-drivers.html).

### Overview
CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a transactional and consistent key:value store. The primary design goals are support for ACID transactions, horizontal scalability and survivability, hence the name. CockroachDB implements a Raft consensus algorithm for consistency. It aims to tolerate disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention. CockroachDB nodes (RoachNodes) are symmetric; a design goal is homogeneous deployment (one binary) with minimal configuration.

CockroachDB implements a single, monolithic sorted map from key to value
where both keys and values are byte strings (not unicode). CockroachDB
scales linearly (theoretically up to 4 exabytes (4E) of logical
data). The map is composed of one or more ranges and each range is
backed by data stored in [RocksDB][0] (a variant of [LevelDB][1]), and is
replicated to a total of three or more CockroachDB servers. Ranges are
defined by start and end keys. Ranges are merged and split to maintain
total byte size within a globally configurable min/max size
interval. Range sizes default to target 64M in order to facilitate
quick splits and merges and to distribute load at hotspots within a
key range. Range replicas are intended to be located in disparate
datacenters for survivability (e.g. `{ US-East, US-West, Japan }`, `{
Ireland, US-East, US-West}` , `{ Ireland, US-East, US-West, Japan,
Australia }`).

Single mutations to ranges are mediated via an instance of a
distributed consensus algorithm to ensure consistency. Weâ€™ve chosen to
use the [Raft consensus algorithm][2]. All consensus state is stored in
[RocksDB][0].

A single logical mutation may affect multiple key/value pairs. Logical
mutations have ACID transactional semantics. If all keys affected by a
logical mutation fall within the same range, atomicity and consistency
are guaranteed by [Raft][2]; this is the fast commit path. Otherwise, a
non-locking distributed commit protocol is employed between affected
ranges.

CockroachDB provides snapshot isolation (SI) and serializable snapshot
isolation (SSI) semantics, allowing externally consistent, lock-free
reads and writes--both from an historical snapshot timestamp and from
the current wall clock time. SI provides lock-free reads and writes
but still allows write skew. SSI eliminates write skew, but introduces
a performance hit in the case of a contentious system. SSI is the
default isolation; clients must consciously decide to trade
correctness for performance. CockroachDB implements a limited form of
linearalizability, providing ordering for any observer or chain of
observers.

Similar to [Spanner][3] directories, CockroachDB allows configuration of
arbitrary zones of data. This allows replication factor, storage
device type, and/or datacenter location to be chosen to optimize
performance and/or availability. Unlike Spanner, zones are monolithic
and donâ€™t allow movement of fine grained data on the level of entity
groups.
